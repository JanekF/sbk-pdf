Last Christmas#Last Christmas, I gave you my heart#But the very next day you gave it away#This year, to save me from tears#I'll give it to someone special#Last Christmas, I gave you my heart#But the very next day you gave it away#This year, to save me from tears#I'll give it to someone special#Once bitten and twice shy#I keep my distance#But you still catch my eye#Tell me, baby#Do you recognize me?#Well, it's been a year#It doesn't surprise me#(Merry Christmas!) I wrapped it up and sent it#With a note saying, "I love you, " I meant it#Now, I know what a fool I've been#But if you kissed me now#I know you'd fool me again#Last Christmas, I gave you my heart#But the very next day you gave it away#This year, to save me from tears#I'll give it to someone special#Last Christmas,â€¦

Where did your heart go?#I spend my nights down on the wharf#In unlit alleyways#By the church downtown#Where Sally prays#Come down sometime#We'll share a rusty can of corn#And listen to the radio#I love you, I love you, it says#Where did your heart go#Did you put it on a train#Did you leave it in the rain#Or down in Mexico#You cry, but I don't know#I've heard it all before#There it goes again, the slamming of the door#Sometimes the river calls me#And at night it calls my name#Says "put your troubles down beside me"#Things have always been the same#And rock 'n' roll won't teach me#What the river said that night#I jumped into this beauty#And drifted out of sight#Where did your heart go#Did you put it on a train#Did you leave it in the rain#Or down in Mexico

Club tropicana#Let me take you to the place#Where membership's a smiling face#Brush shoulders with the stars#Where strangers take you by the hand#And welcome you to wonderland #From beneath their panamas#Club Tropicana, drinks are free#Fun and sunshine, there's enough for everyone#All that's missing is the sea#But don't worry, you can suntan!#Castaways and Lovers meet#Then kiss in Tropicana's heat#Watch the waves break on the bay#Soft white sands, a blue lagoon#Cocktail time, a summer's tune#A whole night's holiday!#Club Tropicana, drinks are free#Fun and sunshine, there's enough for everyone#All that's missing is the sea#But don't worry, you can suntan!#Club Tropicana, drinks are free#Fun and sunshine, there's enough for everyone#All that's missing is the sea#But don't…

The Final Countdown

The Final Countdown#We're leaving together,#But still it's farewell#And maybe we'll come back#To earth, who can tell?#I guess there is no one to blame#We're leaving ground (leaving ground)#Will things ever be the same again?#It's the final countdown#The final countdown#Oh#We're heading for Venus (Venus)#And still we stand tall#'Cause maybe they've seen us (seen us)#And welcome us all, yeah#With so many light years to go#And things to be found (to be found)#I'm sure that we'll all miss her so#It's the final countdown#The final countdown#The final countdown#The final countdown#Oh#The final countdown, oh#It's the final count down#The final countdown#The final countdown#The final countdown#Oh#It's the final count down#We're leaving together#The final count down#We'll all miss her so#It's the final countdown#It's the final countdown#Oh#It's the final countdown, yeah

Do they owe us a living?#Fuck the politically minded, here's something I want to say,#About the state of nation, the way it treats us today.#At school they give you shit, drop you in the pit,#You try, you try, you try to get out, but you can't because they've fucked you about.#Then you're a prime example of how they must not be,#This is just a sample of what they've done to you and me.##Do they owe us a living?#Of course they do, of course they do.#Owe us a living?#Of course they do, of course they do.#Owe us a living?#OF COURSE THEY FUCKING DO.##Don't want me anymore, cos I threw it on the floor.#Used to call me sweet thing, I'm nobody's plaything,#And now that I am different, 'd love to bust my head,#You'd love to see me cop-out, 'd love to see me dead.##Do they owe us a living?#Of course they do, of course they do.#Owe us a living?#Of course they do, of course they do.#Owe us a living?#OF COURSE THEY FUCKING DO.##The living that is owed to me I'm never going to get,#They've buggered this old world up, up to their necks in dept.#They'd give you a lobotomy for something you ain't done,#They'll make you an epitomy of everything that's wrong.##Do they owe us a living?#Of course they do, of course they do.#Owe us a living?#Of course they do, of course they do.#Owe us a living?#OF COURSE THEY FUCKING DO.##Don't take any notice of what the public think,#They're so hyped up with T.V., they just don't want to think.#They'll use you as a target for demands and for advice,#When you don't want to hear it they'll say you're full of vice.##Do they owe us a living?#Of course they do, of course they do.#Owe us a living?#Of course they do, of course they do.#Owe us a living?#OF COURSE THEY FUCKING DO.

Punk is dead#Yes that's right, punk is dead#It's just another cheap product for the consumers head#Bubblegum rock on plastic transistors#Schoolboy sedition backed by big time promoters#CBS promote the Clash#Ain't for revolution, it's just for cash#Punk became a fashion just like hippy used to be#Ain't got a thing to do with your or me##Movements are systems and systems kill#Movements are expressions of the public will#Punk became a movement cos we all felt lost#Leaders sold out and now we all pay the cost#Punk narcissism was a social napalm#Steve Jones started doing real harm#Preaching revolution, anarchy and change#Sucked from the system that had given him his name##Well I'm tired of staring through shit stained glass#Tired of staring up a superstars arse#I've got an arse and crap and a name#I'm just waiting for my fifteen minutes fame##Steven Jones, you're napalm#If you're so pretty vacant, why do you smarm?#Patti Smith, you're napalm, your write with your hand#But it's Rimbaud's arm##And me, yes, I, do I want to burn?#Is there something I can learn?#Do I need a business man to promote my angle#Can I resist the carrots that fame and fortune dangle#I see the velvet zippies in their bondage gear#The social elite with safetypins in their ear#I watch and understand that it don't mean a thing#The scorpions might attack, but the systems stole the sting#PUNK IS DEAD. PUNK IS DEAD. PUNK IS DEAD
